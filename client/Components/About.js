        <h1>Hi, I'm Dougal!</h1>

        <p>Am I lost? Please contact my pawrents Gabriela Medina & Stephen Costello. They're probably super worried and I miss them so much.</p>

        <p>Phone: 516-532-4559 or 347-640-1321</p>

        <p>Email: gmedina229@gmail.com or stephen.costello1991@gmail.com</p>

        While my pawrent are on their way, here is a little bit about me:
          <ul>
            <li>I loooove treats. I'll do anything for a treat. Especially peanut butter and sweet potatoes. Sometimes when I'm scared though I won't eat treats so don't worry if I'm not eating right away.</li>
            <li>My pawrents made me go to school so I'm a smart cookie (if it means i get cookies!). I can sit, lie down, wait, look at (me) you, leave it, give the paw, show belly, and spin. I love learning new tricks too...did I mention I love treats?</li>
            <li>My hoomans don't let me go on their super cozy bed :( BUT they did give me my own safe space they call a "crate". I don't mind hanging out in my crate for about 3 hours or overnight when everyone is alseep. My pawrents always give me treats when I'm in my crate. They're the best.</li>
            <li>I get a big bowl of VDOG dog food three times a day. My pawrents only give me one cup per meal but I try to tell them every day that I want more because its so yummy. They never listen but after I eat I get to go on a walk so its okay. I always get treats on my walks :D</li>
          </ul>
